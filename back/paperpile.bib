  abstract     = {Encounters among bacteria and their viral predators
                  (bacteriophages) are among the most common ecological
                  interactions on Earth. These encounters are likely to occur
                  with regularity inside surface-bound communities that microbes
                  most often occupy in natural environments. Such communities,
                  termed biofilms, are spatially constrained: interactions
                  become limited to near neighbors, diffusion of solutes and
                  particulates can be reduced, and there is pronounced
                  heterogeneity in nutrient access and physiological state. It
                  is appreciated from prior theoretical work that phage-bacteria
                  interactions are fundamentally different in spatially
                  structured contexts, as opposed to well-mixed liquid culture.
                  Spatially structured communities are predicted to promote the
                  protection of susceptible host cells from phage exposure, and
                  thus weaken selection for phage resistance. The details and
                  generality of this prediction in realistic biofilm
                  environments, however, are not known. Here, we explore
                  phage-host interactions using experiments and simulations that
                  are tuned to represent the essential elements of biofilm
                  communities. Our simulations show that in biofilms,
                  phage-resistant cells-as their relative abundance
                  increases-can protect clusters of susceptible cells from phage
                  exposure, promoting the coexistence of susceptible and
                  phage-resistant bacteria under a large array of conditions. We
                  characterize the population dynamics underlying this
                  coexistence, and we show that coexistence is recapitulated in
                  an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal
                  microscopy. Our results provide a clear view into the dynamics
                  of phage resistance in biofilms with single-cell resolution of
                  the underlying cell-virion interactions, linking the
                  predictions of canonical theory to realistic models and in
                  vitro experiments of biofilm growth.IMPORTANCE In the natural
                  environment, bacteria most often live in communities bound to
                  one another by secreted adhesives. These communities, or
                  biofilms, play a central role in biogeochemical cycling,
                  microbiome functioning, wastewater treatment, and disease.
                  Wherever there are bacteria, there are also viruses that
                  attack them, called phages. Interactions between bacteria and
                  phages are likely to occur ubiquitously in biofilms. We show
                  here, using simulations and experiments, that biofilms will in
                  most conditions allow phage-susceptible bacteria to be
                  protected from phage exposure, if they are growing alongside
                  other cells that are phage resistant. This result has
                  implications for the fundamental ecology of phage-bacteria
                  interactions, as well as the development of phage-based
                  antimicrobial therapeutics.},

                  components: the virus, the healthy host, and the infected host

                  and diffusion. The solution to the full model reveals a
                  maximum in the dependence of the velocity of viral propagation
                  on its equilibrium adsorption constant, suggesting that
                  conditions can be chosen where viruses which adsorb poorly to
                  their hosts will replicate faster in plaques than those which
                  adsorb well. Analytic expressions for the propagation velocity

                  assume a static state into which to expand, which is not

                  both the host (bacteria) and the infectious agent
                  (bacteriophage) have similar growth rates. Here, we build on

                  infectious bacteriophage front propagating into an
                  exponentially growing population of bacteria, focusing on the
                  situation where the hosts are also mobile, e.g., swimming
                  bacteria. In this case, both the infectious agent and the
                  infected host populations take on the form of self-similar
                  travelling waves with a fixed wave speed, as in FKPP theory,
                  but the infected host wave also grows exponentially. Depending
                  on the population under consideration, wave speeds are either
                  advanced or retarded compared to the non-growing case. We
                  identify a novel speed selection mechanism in which the shape
                  of the bacteriophage wave controls these various wave speeds.

                  predation pressure by bacteriophages. Bacteria use a variety
                  of molecular mechanisms to defend themselves from phage
                  predation. However, since phages are nonmotile, perhaps the
                  simplest defense against phage is for bacteria to move faster
                  than phages. In particular, chemotaxis, the active migration
                  of bacteria up attractant gradients, may help the bacteria
                  escape slowly diffusing phages. Here we study phage infection
                  dynamics in migrating bacterial populations driven by
                  chemotaxis through low viscosity agar plates. We find that
                  expanding phage-bacteria populations supports two moving
                  fronts, an outermost bacterial front driven by nutrient uptake
                  and chemotaxis and an inner phage front at which the bacterial
                  population collapses due to phage predation. We show that with
                  increasing adsorption rate and initial phage population, the
                  speed of the moving phage front increases, eventually
                  overtaking the bacterial front and driving the system across a
                  transition from a regime where bacterial front speed exceeds
                  that of the phage front to one where bacteria must evolve
                  phage resistance to survive. Our data support the claim that
                  this process requires phage to hitchhike with moving bacteria.
                  A deterministic model recapitulates the transition under the
                  assumption that phage virulence declines with host growth rate
                  which we confirm experimentally. Finally, near the transition
                  between regimes we observe macroscopic fluctuations in
                  bacterial densities at the phage front. Our work opens a new,

                  hybridization. Primer extension experiments and
                  beta-galactosidase fusions confirmed three independent
                  promoter sites preceding genes spaB, spaS and spaI.
                  beta-Galactosidase expression of spaB, spaS and spaI promoter
                  lacZ fusions initiated in mid-exponential growth. Maximal
                  activities were reached at the transition to stationary growth
                  and were collinear with subtilin production. The lacZ activity
                  was dependent on co-expression with the two-component
                  regulatory system spaRK. The presence of subtilin was needed
                  for efficient expression of all three promoter lacZ fusions.
                  This suggests a transcriptional autoregulation according to a
                  quorum-sensing mechanism with subtilin as autoinducer and
                  signal transduction via SpaRK. Additionally, spaR expression
                  was found to be under positive control of the alternative
                  sigma factor H. Deletion of sigma H strongly decreased
                  subtilin production. Full subtilin production could be
                  restored after in-trans complementation of spaR. Deletion of
                  the major B. subtilis transition state regulator AbrB strongly
                  increased subtilin production. These results show that the
                  spaRK two-component regulatory system, and hence subtilin
                  biosynthesis and immunity, is under dual control of two
                  independent regulatory systems: autoinduction via subtilin and
                  transcriptional regulation via sigma factor H.},

                  microorganisms can gain a selective advantage by inhibiting
                  nearby competing species1. However, despite their genetic
                  potential2,3, natural isolates often make only small amounts
                  of antibiotics, and laboratory evolution can lead to loss
                  rather than enhancement of antibiotic production4. Here, we
                  show that, due to competition with antibiotic-resistant
                  cheater cells, increased levels of antibiotic production can
                  actually decrease the selective advantage to producers.
                  Competing fluorescently labelled Escherichia coli colicin
                  producers with non-producing resistant and sensitive strains
                  on solid media, we found that although producer colonies can
                  greatly benefit from the inhibition of nearby sensitive
                  colonies, this benefit is shared with resistant colonies
                  growing in their vicinity. A simple model, which accounts for
                  such local competitive and inhibitory interactions, suggests
                  that the advantage of producers varies non-monotonically with
                  the amount of production. Indeed, experimentally varying the
                  amount of production shows a peak in selection for producers,
                  reflecting a trade-off between benefit gained by inhibiting
                  sensitive competitors and loss due to an increased
                  contribution to resistant cheater colonies. These results help
                  explain the low level of antibiotic production observed for
                  natural species and can help direct laboratory evolution
                  experiments selecting for increased or novel production of

  abstract     = {One view of the coevolution of parasites and their hosts is
                  that of a gene-for-gene arms race between host defenses and
                  parasite counterdefenses. We have incorporated mutations into
                  a model of the ecological interactions between bacteria and
                  virulent phage to determine rates of mutation that would be
                  consistent with this scenario. The model assumes an open
                  habitat (e.g., a chemostat) in which virulent phage and
                  sensitive bacteria can coexist. Equilibrium densities of
                  bacteria and phage are inversely proportional to the
                  efficiency with which phage irreversibly adsorb to their
                  hosts. The absolute rate at which mutations appear is
                  proportional to the product of habitat size, population
                  density, rate of increase, and mutation rate. The bacterium
                  Escherichia coli B readily evolved resistance to virulent
                  phage T4 in our chemostat experiments. Approximately 100 h was
                  required for the appearance, establishment, and attainment of
                  a resource-limited population of these T4-resistant mutants;
                  this time period is close to that predicted from the model
                  when the parameters of the model are estimated independently.
                  No host-range phage T4 mutants appeared, yet the phage
                  persisted even after the resistant bacteria had become
                  resource-limited. We hypothesized that the failure to observe
                  corresponding phage mutants indicates mutational constraints
                  on the coevolutionary potential of this phage. We also
                  hypothesized that the persistence of the wild-type phage
                  indicates the presence of a minority population of sensitive
                  bacteria that persists because of selective constraints which
                  produce a competitive disadvantage for resistant bacteria
                  under resource-limiting conditions. Both of these hypotheses
                  were verified. Host-range T4 mutants occurred at a rate on the
                  order of 10-12 or less, and could not be expected in the
                  chemostats for several years. T4-sensitive and -resistant
                  bacteria had very nearly the same exponential growth rates,
                  but at steady state the latter had approximately a 50\%
                  disadvantage. We also examined the interactions of E. coli B
                  and virulent phages T2, T5, and T7 for evidence of selective
                  and mutational constraints on the bacteria and phage,
                  respectively. Under the conditions of our experiments,
                  T2-resistant and T7-resistant (but not T5-resistant) bacteria
                  also had clear competitive disadvantages to sensitive bacteria
                  under resource-limiting conditions. We were able to isolate T2
                  and T7 (but not T5) host-range mutants. Even with T2 and T7,
                  however, we could not select indefinitely for host-range
                  mutants active against higher-order resistant bacteria. This
                  general asymmetry in the coevolutionary potential of bacteria
                  and phage occurs because mutations conferring resistance may
                  arise by either the loss or alteration of gene function, while
                  host-range mutations depend on specific alterations of gene
                  function. These constraints preclude observing endless arms
                  races between bacteria and virulent phage. Instead, because of
                  the asymmetry in coevolutionary potential of these hosts and
                  parasites, we anticipate that natural communities of coliform
                  bacteria and virulent coliphage are dominated by bacterial
                  clones resistant to all co-occurring virulent phage. If
                  virulent phage to which the dominant clones are sensitive
                  should appear, then bacteria will either rapidly evolve
                  resistance or be replaced by existing clones resistant to the
                  phage. Thus, the role of virulent phage in structuring
                  communities of bacteria is seen as important in determining
                  clonal composition but unimportant in determining overall
                  bacterial densities.}

                  experimental observations of bacteria-phage interactions. A
                  lytic phage effectively kills bacterial cells in a colony,
                  leading to significant consequences for its morphology and
                  expansion. Through computational modeling, we observe that
                  phage interactions with bacteria produce phage-plaque regions
                  characterized by cell death, reorganization, and altered
                  colony growth dynamics. As phages predate, surviving cells
                  tend to re-align toward the phage-affected region, forming a
                  more ordered structure. This reordering effect not only
                  reduces the radial spread of the colony but, in highly
                  virulent scenarios, generates an inflow of cells toward the

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Subtilin is a peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
                  natively produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633. It is encoded
                  in a gene cluster spaBTCSIFEGRK (spa-locus) consisting of four
                  transcriptional units: spaS (subtilin pre-peptide), spaBTC
                  (modification and export), spaIFEG (immunity) and spaRK
                  (regulation). Despite the pioneer understanding on subtilin
                  biosynthesis, a robust platform to facilitate subtilin
                  research and improve subtilin production is still a poorly
                  explored spot. RESULTS: In this work, the intact spa-locus was
                  successfully integrated into the chromosome of Bacillus
                  subtilis W168, which is the by far best-characterized
                  Gram-positive model organism with powerful genetics and many
                  advantages in industrial use. Through systematic analysis of
                  spa-promoter activities in B. subtilis W168 wild type and
                  mutant strains, our work demonstrates that subtilin is basally
                  expressed in B. subtilis W168, and the transition state
                  regulator AbrB strongly represses subtilin biosynthesis in a
                  growth phase-dependent manner. The deletion of AbrB remarkably
                  enhanced subtilin gene expression, resulting in comparable
                  yield of bioactive subtilin production as for B. subtilis
                  ATCC6633. However, while in B. subtilis ATCC6633 AbrB
                  regulates subtilin gene expression via SigH, which in turn
                  activates spaRK, AbrB of B. subtilis W168 controls subtilin
                  gene expression in SigH-independent manner, except for the
                  regulation of spaBTC. Furthermore, the work shows that
                  subtilin biosynthesis in B. subtilis W168 is regulated by the
                  two-component regulatory system SpaRK and strictly relies on
                  subtilin itself as inducer to fulfill the autoregulatory
                  circuit. In addition, by incorporating the subtilin-producing
                  system (spa-locus) and subtilin-reporting system (PpsdA-lux)
                  together, we developed "online" reporter strains to
                  efficiently monitor the dynamics of subtilin biosynthesis.
                  CONCLUSIONS: Within this study, the model organism B. subtilis
                  W168 was successfully established as a novel platform for
                  subtilin biosynthesis and the underlying regulatory mechanism
                  was comprehensively characterized. This work will not only
                  facilitate genetic (engineering) studies on subtilin, but also
                  pave the way for its industrial production. More broadly, this
                  work will shed new light on the heterologous production of
                  other lantibiotics.},

                  reduced instrumental footprints, low unit cost, facile

                  present a method here that, in contrast, exploits the power of
                  adaptation among antibiotic producers to accelerate the
                  discovery of antibiotics. A competition-based adaptive
                  laboratory evolution scheme is presented whereby an
                  antibiotic-producing microorganism is competed against a
                  target pathogen and serially passed over time until the
                  producer evolves the ability to synthesize a chemical entity
                  that inhibits growth of the pathogen. When multiple
                  Streptomyces clavuligerus replicates were adaptively evolved
                  against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N315 in
                  this manner, a strain emerged that acquired the ability to
                  constitutively produce holomycin. In contrast, no holomycin
                  could be detected from the unevolved wild-type strain.
                  Moreover, genome re-sequencing revealed that the evolved
                  strain had lost pSCL4, a large 1.8 Mbp plasmid, and acquired
                  several single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that have

                  relative to both B1 and B2 while no difference is detected

                  to computational modeling of the population dynamics of phage
                  and bacterial interactions. The earliest model was described

                  systems of ordinary differential delay equations with delay
                  dependent coefficients. In this paper we continue these
                  studies in two respects. First, we show that the dynamics is
                  sensitive to the phage mortality function, and in particular
                  to the parameter we use to measure the density dependent phage
                  mortality rate. Second, we incorporate spatial effects by
                  deriving, in one spatial dimension, a delay reaction-diffusion
                  model in which the delay term is rigorously derived by solving
                  a von Foerster equation. Using this model, we formally compute
                  the speed at which the viral infection spreads through the
                  domain and investigate how this speed depends on the system
                  parameters. Numerical simulations suggest that the minimum

                  factors of host-phage biology have not yet been integrated

                  spatial phage-bacteria model to describe the propagation of
                  phages and bacteria in different types of nutrient media.
                  Unlike existing models, we construct a more realistic
                  reaction-diffusion model that incorporates inoculum and
                  bacterial growth and movement, then rigorous mathematical
                  analysis is challenging. We study traveling wave solutions and
                  obtain complete information about the existence and
                  nonexistence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions. The
                  threshold conditions for the existence and nonexistence of
                  traveling wave solutions are obtained by using Schauder?s
                  fixed point theorem, limiting argument, and one-sided Laplace

                  1–6 . In contrast, virulent phage rapidly lyse bacteria
                  populations within well-mixed in vitro environments, selecting
                  for the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants 7 ,
                  which in turn select for host-range expansion phage mutants 8
                  , leading to the emergence of complex cross-infection networks
                  9 , and eventually the collapse of phage populations
                  altogether 10,11 . This gap in outcome raises a question: what
                  enables long-term phage-bacteria coexistence? Here, we show
                  how interactions in space can facilitate stable coexistence
                  and long-range transport of virulent phage along with
                  migrating bacteria. Through the joint use of theory,
                  simulation, and experiments across multiple phage-bacteria
                  systems, we reveal a chemotaxis-driven mechanism which
                  robustly stabilizes coexistence and dispersal of virulent
                  phages with migrating hosts, while minimizing the potential
                  for coevolutionary-induced collapse of either bacteria or
                  phage. These findings suggest the ecological relevance of
                  spatial interaction mechanisms that reinforce stability
                  between antagonistic partners, even in the absence of
                  perpetual cycles of defense and counter-defense, that may be
                  broadly applicable across phage-bacteria pairs.}

  abstract     = {Understanding microbial ecosystems means unlocking the path
                  toward a deeper knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of
                  life. Engineered microbial communities are also extremely
                  relevant to tackling some of today's grand societal
                  challenges. Advanced meta-omics experimental techniques
                  provide crucial insights into microbial communities, but have
                  been so far mostly used for descriptive, exploratory
                  approaches to answer the initial 'who is there?' QUESTION: An
                  ecosystem is a complex network of dynamic spatio-temporal
                  interactions among organisms as well as between organisms and
                  the environment. Mathematical models with their abstraction
                  capability are essential to capture the underlying phenomena
                  and connect the different scales at which these systems act.
                  Differential equation models and constraint-based
                  stoichiometric models are deterministic approaches that can
                  successfully provide a macroscopic description of the outcome
                  from microscopic behaviors. In this mini-review, we present
                  classical and recent applications of these modeling methods
                  and illustrate the potential of their integration. Indeed,
                  approaches that can capture multiple scales are needed in
                  order to understand emergent patterns in ecosystems and their
                  dynamics regulated by different spatio-temporal phenomena. We
                  finally discuss promising examples of methods proposing the
                  integration of differential equations with constraint-based
                  stoichiometric models and argue that more work is needed in
                  this direction.},

                  by the development of antibiotic tolerance, a consequence of
                  the ability of S. aureus to enter into a nongrowing, dormant
                  state in which the organisms are referred to as persisters. We
                  report that the clinically approved anthelmintic agent
                  bithionol kills methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
                  persister cells, which correlates with its ability to disrupt
                  the integrity of Gram-positive bacterial membranes.
                  Critically, bithionol exhibits significant selectivity for
                  bacterial compared with mammalian cell membranes. All-atom
                  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the
                  selectivity of bithionol for bacterial membranes correlates
                  with its ability to penetrate and embed in bacterial-mimic
                  lipid bilayers, but not in cholesterol-rich mammalian-mimic
                  lipid bilayers. In addition to causing rapid membrane
                  permeabilization, the insertion of bithionol increases
                  membrane fluidity. By using bithionol and nTZDpa (another
                  membrane-active antimicrobial agent), as well as analogs of
                  these compounds, we show that the activity of membrane-active
                  compounds against MRSA persisters positively correlates with
                  their ability to increase membrane fluidity, thereby
                  establishing an accurate biophysical indicator for estimating
                  antipersister potency. Finally, we demonstrate that, in
                  combination with gentamicin, bithionol effectively reduces
                  bacterial burdens in a mouse model of chronic deep-seated MRSA
                  infection. This work highlights the potential repurposing of
                  bithionol as an antipersister therapeutic agent.},

  abstract     = {Alternating antibiotic therapy, in which pairs of drugs are
                  cycled during treatment, has been suggested as a means to
                  inhibit the evolution of de novo resistance while avoiding the
                  toxicity associated with more traditional combination therapy.
                  However, it remains unclear under which conditions and by what
                  means such alternating treatments impede the evolution of
                  resistance. Here, we tracked multistep evolution of resistance
                  in replicate populations of Staphylococcus aureus during 22 d
                  of continuously increasing single-, mixed-, and
                  alternating-drug treatment. In all three tested drug pairs,
                  the alternating treatment reduced the overall rate of
                  resistance by slowing the acquisition of resistance to one of
                  the two component drugs, sometimes as effectively as mixed
                  treatment. This slower rate of evolution is reflected in the
                  genome-wide mutational profiles; under alternating treatments,
                  bacteria acquire mutations in different genes than under
                  corresponding single-drug treatments. To test whether this
                  observed constraint on adaptive paths reflects trade-offs in
                  which resistance to one drug is accompanied by sensitivity to
                  a second drug, we profiled many single-step mutants for
                  cross-resistance. Indeed, the average cross-resistance of
                  single-step mutants can help predict whether or not evolution
                  was slower in alternating drugs. Together, these results show
                  that despite the complex evolutionary landscape of multidrug
                  resistance, alternating-drug therapy can slow evolution by
                  constraining the mutational paths toward resistance.},

                  (phages) to treat bacterial infections, has been around for
                  almost a century. The universal decline in the effectiveness
                  of antibiotics has generated renewed interest in revisiting
                  this practice. Conventionally, phage therapy relies on the use
                  of naturally-occurring phages to infect and lyse bacteria at
                  the site of infection. Biotechnological advances have further
                  expanded the repertoire of potential phage therapeutics to
                  include novel strategies using bioengineered phages and
                  purified phage lytic proteins. Current research on the use of
                  phages and their lytic proteins, specifically against
                  multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, suggests phage
                  therapy has the potential to be used as either an alternative
                  or a supplement to antibiotic treatments. Antibacterial
                  therapies, whether phage- or antibiotic-based, each have
                  relative advantages and disadvantages; accordingly, many
                  considerations must be taken into account when designing novel
                  therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating bacterial
                  infections. Although much is still unknown about the
                  interactions between phage, bacteria, and human host, the time

                  In bacteria, traditional estimates using experimental or
                  comparative genetic methods are prone to statistical
                  uncertainty and consequently estimates vary by over one order
                  of magnitude. With the advent of next-generation sequencing,
                  more accurate estimates are now possible. We sequenced 19
                  Escherichia coli genomes from a 40,000-generation evolution
                  experiment and directly inferred the point-mutation rate based
                  on the accumulation of synonymous substitutions. The resulting
                  estimate was 8.9 × 10(-11) per base-pair per generation, and
                  there was a significant bias toward increased AT-content. We
                  also compared our results with published genome sequence
                  datasets for other bacterial evolution experiments. Given the
                  power of our approach, our estimate represents the most

                  commonly associated with health care cause a substantial
                  health burden. Updated national estimates for this group of
                  pathogens are needed to inform public health action. METHODS:
                  Using data from patients hospitalized in a cohort of 890 U.S.
                  hospitals during the period 2012-2017, we generated national
                  case counts for both hospital-onset and community-onset
                  infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
                  aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE),
                  extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in
                  Enterobacteriaceae suggestive of extended-spectrum
                  beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, carbapenem-resistant
                  Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter
                  species, and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The hospital
                  cohort in the study accounted for 41.6 million
                  hospitalizations (>20\% of U.S. hospitalizations annually).
                  The overall rate of clinical cultures was 292 cultures per
                  1000 patient-days and was stable throughout the time period.
                  In 2017, these pathogens caused an estimated 622,390
                  infections (95\% confidence interval [CI], 579,125 to 665,655)
                  among hospitalized patients. Of these infections, 517,818
                  (83\%) had their onset in the community, and 104,572 (17\%)
                  had their onset in the hospital. MRSA and ESBL infections
                  accounted for the majority of the infections (52\% and 32\%,
                  respectively). Between 2012 and 2017, the incidence decreased
                  for MRSA infection (from 114.18 to 93.68 cases per 10,000
                  hospitalizations), VRE infection (from 24.15 to 15.76 per
                  10,000), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter species infection
                  (from 3.33 to 2.47 per 10,000), and MDR P. aeruginosa
                  infection (from 13.10 to 9.43 per 10,000), with decreases
                  ranging from -20.5\% to -39.2\%. The incidence of
                  carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection did not
                  change significantly (from 3.36 to 3.79 cases per 10,000
                  hospitalizations). The incidence of ESBL infection increased
                  by 53.3\% (from 37.55 to 57.12 cases per 10,000
                  hospitalizations), a change driven by an increase in
                  community-onset cases. CONCLUSIONS: Health care-associated
                  antimicrobial resistance places a substantial burden on
                  patients in the United States. Further work is needed to
                  identify improved interventions for both the inpatient and
                  outpatient settings. (Funded by the Centers for Disease

                  Streptomyces was isolated from the agricultural soil of
                  Narnaul, Haryana India. Physiological, biochemical
                  characteristics and 16S ribosomal RNA sequence homology
                  studies revealed that it was similar to Streptomyces levis
                  (sequence similarity 100\%). The microbial strain was
                  submitted to Genomebio Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Pune,
                  Maharashtra, India under Accession No. EU124569. The isolated
                  strain was found to produce extracellular active compound
                  showing strong antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella
                  pneumoniae MTCC 109, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741 and
                  Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96. The antibacterial compound was
                  successfully isolated and purified. Structure elucidation of
                  antibacterial metabolite with EI-MS/ HRMS showed molecular ion

                  mainly do not exist solely but form communities of single or
                  mixed species. Within such microbial populations and between
                  the microbes and a eukaryotic host, various microbial
                  interactions take place in an ever-changing environment. Those
                  microbial interactions are crucial for a successful
                  establishment and maintenance of a microbial population. The
                  basic unit of interaction is the gene expression of each
                  organism in this community in response to biotic or abiotic
                  stimuli. Differential gene expression is responsible for
                  producing exchangeable molecules involved in the interactions,
                  ultimately leading to community behavior. Cooperative and
                  competitive interactions within bacterial communities and
                  between the associated bacteria and the host are the focus of
                  this review, emphasizing microbial cell-cell communication

                  interactions are the key strategy to colonize and establish in
                  a variety of different environments. These interactions
                  involve all ecological aspects, including physiochemical
                  changes, metabolite exchange, metabolite conversion,
                  signaling, chemotaxis and genetic exchange resulting in
                  genotype selection. In addition, the establishment in the
                  environment depends on the species diversity, since high
                  functional redundancy in the microbial community increases the
                  competitive ability of the community, decreasing the
                  possibility of an invader to establish in this environment.
                  Therefore, these associations are the result of a co-evolution
                  process that leads to the adaptation and specialization,
                  allowing the occupation of different niches, by reducing
                  biotic and abiotic stress or exchanging growth factors and
                  signaling. Microbial interactions occur by the transference of
                  molecular and genetic information, and many mechanisms can be
                  involved in this exchange, such as secondary metabolites,
                  siderophores, quorum sensing system, biofilm formation, and
                  cellular transduction signaling, among others. The ultimate
                  unit of interaction is the gene expression of each organism in
                  response to an environmental (biotic or abiotic) stimulus,
                  which is responsible for the production of molecules involved
                  in these interactions. Therefore, in the present review, we
                  focused on some molecular mechanisms involved in the microbial
                  interaction, not only in microbial-host interaction, which has
                  been exploited by other reviews, but also in the molecular
                  strategy used by different microorganisms in the environment
                  that can modulate the establishment and structuration of the
                  microbial community.},

               such as micro-colonies or biofilms and are rare to be obtained as
               pure cultures from the environment. Hence, there is always a
               likelihood of microbe–microbe interactions among these
               communities, which can either be positive or negative. Various
               factors such as physical, chemical, biological and genetics
               regulate such interactions and the molecular mechanisms involved
               in these interactions between microorganisms. One of the most
               important positive microbial interactions is synergism. Microbial
               synergism is defined as the microbial interaction in which both
               or all the microbial population involved gets benefitted, by
               supporting each other’s growth and proliferation. These
               cooperative systems are ubiquitous in nature and are involved in
               various beneficial activities such as driving various
               biogeochemical processes, enhancing soil biomass and nutrients,
               promoting plant growth, degradation of food in the colon, waste
               water treatment, medicine and food industry. Therefore, in the

               interactions and cooperation between communities. Further, we

               which influences the synergistic process such as environment,
               substrate, etc. Finally, this chapter emphasizes the potential
               applications and future prospects of microbial synergism in the
