  abstract     = {Encounters among bacteria and their viral predators
                  (bacteriophages) are among the most common ecological
                  interactions on Earth. These encounters are likely to occur
                  with regularity inside surface-bound communities that microbes
                  most often occupy in natural environments. Such communities,
                  termed biofilms, are spatially constrained: interactions
                  become limited to near neighbors, diffusion of solutes and
                  particulates can be reduced, and there is pronounced
                  heterogeneity in nutrient access and physiological state. It
                  is appreciated from prior theoretical work that phage-bacteria
                  interactions are fundamentally different in spatially
                  structured contexts, as opposed to well-mixed liquid culture.
                  Spatially structured communities are predicted to promote the
                  protection of susceptible host cells from phage exposure, and
                  thus weaken selection for phage resistance. The details and
                  generality of this prediction in realistic biofilm
                  environments, however, are not known. Here, we explore
                  phage-host interactions using experiments and simulations that
                  are tuned to represent the essential elements of biofilm
                  communities. Our simulations show that in biofilms,
                  phage-resistant cells-as their relative abundance
                  increases-can protect clusters of susceptible cells from phage
                  exposure, promoting the coexistence of susceptible and
                  phage-resistant bacteria under a large array of conditions. We
                  characterize the population dynamics underlying this
                  coexistence, and we show that coexistence is recapitulated in
                  an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal
                  microscopy. Our results provide a clear view into the dynamics
                  of phage resistance in biofilms with single-cell resolution of
                  the underlying cell-virion interactions, linking the
                  predictions of canonical theory to realistic models and in
                  vitro experiments of biofilm growth.IMPORTANCE In the natural
                  environment, bacteria most often live in communities bound to
                  one another by secreted adhesives. These communities, or
                  biofilms, play a central role in biogeochemical cycling,
                  microbiome functioning, wastewater treatment, and disease.
                  Wherever there are bacteria, there are also viruses that
                  attack them, called phages. Interactions between bacteria and
                  phages are likely to occur ubiquitously in biofilms. We show
                  here, using simulations and experiments, that biofilms will in
                  most conditions allow phage-susceptible bacteria to be
                  protected from phage exposure, if they are growing alongside
                  other cells that are phage resistant. This result has
                  implications for the fundamental ecology of phage-bacteria
                  interactions, as well as the development of phage-based
                  antimicrobial therapeutics.},

                  assume a static state into which to expand, which is not

                  infectious bacteriophage front propagating into an
                  exponentially growing population of bacteria, focusing on the
                  situation where the hosts are also mobile, e.g., swimming
                  bacteria. In this case, both the infectious agent and the
                  infected host populations take on the form of self-similar
                  travelling waves with a fixed wave speed, as in FKPP theory,
                  but the infected host wave also grows exponentially. Depending
                  on the population under consideration, wave speeds are either
                  advanced or retarded compared to the non-growing case. We
                  identify a novel speed selection mechanism in which the shape
                  of the bacteriophage wave controls these various wave speeds.

                  predation pressure by bacteriophages. Bacteria use a variety
                  of molecular mechanisms to defend themselves from phage
                  predation. However, since phages are nonmotile, perhaps the
                  simplest defense against phage is for bacteria to move faster
                  than phages. In particular, chemotaxis, the active migration
                  of bacteria up attractant gradients, may help the bacteria
                  escape slowly diffusing phages. Here we study phage infection
                  dynamics in migrating bacterial populations driven by
                  chemotaxis through low viscosity agar plates. We find that
                  expanding phage-bacteria populations supports two moving
                  fronts, an outermost bacterial front driven by nutrient uptake
                  and chemotaxis and an inner phage front at which the bacterial
                  population collapses due to phage predation. We show that with
                  increasing adsorption rate and initial phage population, the
                  speed of the moving phage front increases, eventually
                  overtaking the bacterial front and driving the system across a
                  transition from a regime where bacterial front speed exceeds
                  that of the phage front to one where bacteria must evolve
                  phage resistance to survive. Our data support the claim that
                  this process requires phage to hitchhike with moving bacteria.
                  A deterministic model recapitulates the transition under the
                  assumption that phage virulence declines with host growth rate
                  which we confirm experimentally. Finally, near the transition
                  between regimes we observe macroscopic fluctuations in
                  bacterial densities at the phage front. Our work opens a new,
                  spatio-temporal, line of investigation into the

                  that of a gene-for-gene arms race between host defenses and

                  a model of the ecological interactions between bacteria and
                  virulent phage to determine rates of mutation that would be
                  consistent with this scenario. The model assumes an open
                  habitat (e.g., a chemostat) in which virulent phage and
                  sensitive bacteria can coexist. Equilibrium densities of
                  bacteria and phage are inversely proportional to the
                  efficiency with which phage irreversibly adsorb to their
                  hosts. The absolute rate at which mutations appear is
                  proportional to the product of habitat size, population
                  density, rate of increase, and mutation rate. The bacterium
                  Escherichia coli B readily evolved resistance to virulent
                  phage T4 in our chemostat experiments. Approximately 100 h was
                  required for the appearance, establishment, and attainment of
                  a resource-limited population of these T4-resistant mutants;
                  this time period is close to that predicted from the model
                  when the parameters of the model are estimated independently.
                  No host-range phage T4 mutants appeared, yet the phage
                  persisted even after the resistant bacteria had become
                  resource-limited. We hypothesized that the failure to observe
                  corresponding phage mutants indicates mutational constraints
                  on the coevolutionary potential of this phage. We also
                  hypothesized that the persistence of the wild-type phage
                  indicates the presence of a minority population of sensitive
                  bacteria that persists because of selective constraints which
                  produce a competitive disadvantage for resistant bacteria
                  under resource-limiting conditions. Both of these hypotheses
                  were verified. Host-range T4 mutants occurred at a rate on the
                  order of 10-12 or less, and could not be expected in the
                  chemostats for several years. T4-sensitive and -resistant
                  bacteria had very nearly the same exponential growth rates,
                  but at steady state the latter had approximately a 50\%
                  disadvantage. We also examined the interactions of E. coli B
                  and virulent phages T2, T5, and T7 for evidence of selective
                  and mutational constraints on the bacteria and phage,
                  respectively. Under the conditions of our experiments,
                  T2-resistant and T7-resistant (but not T5-resistant) bacteria
                  also had clear competitive disadvantages to sensitive bacteria
                  under resource-limiting conditions. We were able to isolate T2
                  and T7 (but not T5) host-range mutants. Even with T2 and T7,
                  however, we could not select indefinitely for host-range
                  mutants active against higher-order resistant bacteria. This
                  general asymmetry in the coevolutionary potential of bacteria
                  and phage occurs because mutations conferring resistance may
                  arise by either the loss or alteration of gene function, while
                  host-range mutations depend on specific alterations of gene
                  function. These constraints preclude observing endless arms
                  races between bacteria and virulent phage. Instead, because of
                  the asymmetry in coevolutionary potential of these hosts and
                  parasites, we anticipate that natural communities of coliform
                  bacteria and virulent coliphage are dominated by bacterial
                  clones resistant to all co-occurring virulent phage. If
                  virulent phage to which the dominant clones are sensitive
                  should appear, then bacteria will either rapidly evolve
                  resistance or be replaced by existing clones resistant to the
                  phage. Thus, the role of virulent phage in structuring
                  communities of bacteria is seen as important in determining
                  clonal composition but unimportant in determining overall
                  bacterial densities.}

                  lytic phage effectively kills bacterial cells in a colony,
                  leading to significant consequences for its morphology and
                  expansion. Through computational modeling, we observe that
                  phage interactions with bacteria produce phage-plaque regions
                  characterized by cell death, reorganization, and altered
                  colony growth dynamics. As phages predate, surviving cells
                  tend to re-align toward the phage-affected region, forming a
                  more ordered structure. This reordering effect not only
                  reduces the radial spread of the colony but, in highly
                  virulent scenarios, generates an inflow of cells toward the

                  antibiotic-producing microorganism is competed against a
                  target pathogen and serially passed over time until the
                  producer evolves the ability to synthesize a chemical entity
                  that inhibits growth of the pathogen. When multiple

                  systems of ordinary differential delay equations with delay
                  dependent coefficients. In this paper we continue these
                  studies in two respects. First, we show that the dynamics is
                  sensitive to the phage mortality function, and in particular
                  to the parameter we use to measure the density dependent phage
                  mortality rate. Second, we incorporate spatial effects by
                  deriving, in one spatial dimension, a delay reaction-diffusion
                  model in which the delay term is rigorously derived by solving
                  a von Foerster equation. Using this model, we formally compute
                  the speed at which the viral infection spreads through the

                  parameters. Numerical simulations suggest that the minimum

  abstract     = {Abstract. Phages are ubiquitous in nature, but many essential
                  factors of host-phage biology have not yet been integrated
                  into mathematical models. In this paper, we investigate a
                  spatial phage-bacteria model to describe the propagation of
                  phages and bacteria in different types of nutrient media.
                  Unlike existing models, we construct a more realistic
                  reaction-diffusion model that incorporates inoculum and
                  bacterial growth and movement, then rigorous mathematical
                  analysis is challenging. We study traveling wave solutions and
                  obtain complete information about the existence and
                  nonexistence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions. The
                  threshold conditions for the existence and nonexistence of
                  traveling wave solutions are obtained by using Schauder?s
                  fixed point theorem, limiting argument, and one-sided Laplace
                  transform. Considering different propagation media, we extend
                  the existence of traveling wave solutions from liquid
                  nutrition model to agar model. Moreover, in the absence of
                  bacterial mortality, we obtain the existence of a new
                  traveling wave solution describing phage invasion. We attempt
                  to explain the occurrence of co-transport by the existence and
                  nonexistence of traveling waves, and screen out the key
                  parameters affecting the co-transport of phages and bacteria
                  according to the definition of critical wave speed. Finally,
                  we provide numerical simulations to verify the theoretical
                  results and reveal the effects of key parameters on the
                  propagation of phages and bacteria.},

                  infect bacterial hosts, are the most abundant living entities
                  across diverse environments, coexisting with their bacterial
                  hosts at densities exceeding 10 7 ml −1 in marine surface
                  waters, 10 8 ml −1 in soils, and 10 9 ml −1 in the human gut
                  1–6 . In contrast, virulent phage rapidly lyse bacteria
                  populations within well-mixed in vitro environments, selecting
                  for the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants 7 ,
                  which in turn select for host-range expansion phage mutants 8
                  , leading to the emergence of complex cross-infection networks
                  9 , and eventually the collapse of phage populations
                  altogether 10,11 . This gap in outcome raises a question: what
                  enables long-term phage-bacteria coexistence? Here, we show
                  how interactions in space can facilitate stable coexistence
                  and long-range transport of virulent phage along with
                  migrating bacteria. Through the joint use of theory,
                  simulation, and experiments across multiple phage-bacteria
                  systems, we reveal a chemotaxis-driven mechanism which
                  robustly stabilizes coexistence and dispersal of virulent
                  phages with migrating hosts, while minimizing the potential
                  for coevolutionary-induced collapse of either bacteria or
                  phage. These findings suggest the ecological relevance of
                  spatial interaction mechanisms that reinforce stability
                  between antagonistic partners, even in the absence of
                  perpetual cycles of defense and counter-defense, that may be
                  broadly applicable across phage-bacteria pairs.}

                  the planet with diverse functions and are increasingly
                  harnessed for practical human needs. To deepen the fundamental
                  understanding of their organization and functioning as well as
                  to facilitate their engineering for applications, mathematical
                  modeling has played an increasingly important role.
                  Agent-based models represent a class of powerful quantitative
                  frameworks for investigating microbial communities because of
                  their individualistic nature in describing cells, mechanistic
                  characterization of molecular and cellular processes, and
                  intrinsic ability to produce emergent system properties. This
                  review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in
                  agent-based modeling of microbial communities. It surveys the
                  state-of-the-art algorithms employed to simulate intracellular
                  biomolecular events, single-cell behaviors, intercellular
                  interactions, and interactions between cells and their
                  environments that collectively serve as the driving forces of
                  community behaviors. It also highlights three lines of
                  applications of agent-based modeling, namely, the elucidation
                  of microbial range expansion and colony ecology, the design of
                  synthetic gene circuits and microbial populations for desired
                  behaviors, and the characterization of biofilm formation and
                  dispersal. The review concludes with a discussion of existing
                  challenges, including the computational cost of the modeling,
                  and potential mitigation strategies.},

                  relevant to tackling some of today's grand societal
                  challenges. Advanced meta-omics experimental techniques
                  provide crucial insights into microbial communities, but have
                  been so far mostly used for descriptive, exploratory
                  approaches to answer the initial 'who is there?' QUESTION: An
                  ecosystem is a complex network of dynamic spatio-temporal
                  interactions among organisms as well as between organisms and
                  the environment. Mathematical models with their abstraction
                  capability are essential to capture the underlying phenomena
                  and connect the different scales at which these systems act.
                  Differential equation models and constraint-based
                  stoichiometric models are deterministic approaches that can
                  successfully provide a macroscopic description of the outcome
                  from microscopic behaviors. In this mini-review, we present
                  classical and recent applications of these modeling methods
                  and illustrate the potential of their integration. Indeed,
                  approaches that can capture multiple scales are needed in
                  order to understand emergent patterns in ecosystems and their
                  dynamics regulated by different spatio-temporal phenomena. We
                  finally discuss promising examples of methods proposing the
                  integration of differential equations with constraint-based
                  stoichiometric models and argue that more work is needed in
                  this direction.},
