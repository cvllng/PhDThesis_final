We established a microfluidic droplet production system to encapsulate bacteria in the lab. In this system, we were able to produce stable droplets, encapsulating bacteria for long term incubation in growth conditions. During incubation the droplets could be monitored and certain bacterial strains grew successfully in droplets.
However, after selecting a pair of bacterial strains which exhibit a antagonistic interaction on solid growth medium, we were not able to grow the antibiotic producing strain of \textit{B. subtilis} successfully in droplets and furthermore, we failed to induce antibiotic production and accumulation in liquid.
Further research should investigate other pairs of strains exhibiting antagonistic interactions and first verify that inhibition also happens in liquid culture and both strains grow successfully in droplets before moving to produce droplets with competing bacteria.
