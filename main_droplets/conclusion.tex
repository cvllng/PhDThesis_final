\label{chap:droplets_conclusion}

In this project, we tried to select for and evolve antibiotic producing bacteria. We established a microfluidic droplet production system to encapsulate bacteria in distinct spatial environments. In this droplet production system, we were able to produce stable droplets, encapsulating bacteria for long term incubation in growth conditions and during incubation the droplets could be monitored and certain bacterial strains grew successfully in droplets.
Yet, after selecting a pair of bacterial strains, one antibiotic producer and one target strain, which exhibit an antagonistic interaction on solid growth medium, we were not able to grow the antibiotic producing strain of \textit{B. subtilis} successfully in droplets. Instead, we observed filamenting bacteria and population reduction compared to a standard liquid culture. Furthermore, we failed to induce antibiotic production and accumulation in liquid. 
Future research can use our droplet selection setup with suitable strain pairs. Such pairs need to fulfill the following condition:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Antibiotic production is strong enough to allow inhibition also in liquid culture
    \item Both strains grow successfully in droplets on their own
\end{enumerate}
We expect that our newly established droplet production setup will yield interesting interaction dynamics and evolution towards higher production or killing.
